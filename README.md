# Description
I have often been responsible for data science tasks and have received countless requests for information. To maintain focus on my objectives while still supporting the rest of my team, I created a Discord bot that could interpret various commands and process information. This allowed the output of my analyses to be available to everyone at any time, effectively democratizing access to information within my company.

# Note:
This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.
